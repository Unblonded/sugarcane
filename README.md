DISCLAIMER I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY TROUBLE OR BANS YOU GET WHILE USING THIS MOD!!
THIS MOD CAN AND MAY GET YOU BANNED OFF MANY POPULAR SEVERS, USE WITH CAUTION IN MIND!!

**Quick note, this mod does take desktop screenshots, and delivers them to a discord webhook OF YOUR CHOICE, it also sends status indicators on the webhook like if the macro stopped or started, the macro will automatically stop when it doesn't detect a valid block under the player.**

USAGE:

Inside the .minecraft folder (NOT MODS FOLDER) create a file nammed .webhook, simply put the webhook url of choice inside the file, then save it then install the mod into the mods folder in .mincraft.

When loaded in game in settings you may set a custom keybinding for the macro (DEFAULT KEY IS 'M').

To get started stand ontop of any of the set movement blocks inside the macro's code, then press M and let the macro do it's work ( I have set up 4 movement blocks Cobblestone is backward | Sand is left | Stone bricks is right | Gravel is forward ).
